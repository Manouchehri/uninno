1. Introduction

uninno is a portable unpacking tool for Inno Setup (IS) installers.

Inno Setup is a popular tool for creating software package installers for the
Microsoft Windows operating system. It was written in Delphi by Jordan Russell,
who released under an open source licence.

Other unpacking tools exist, but they are based on the original Inno Setup
source code. As the usual target platform for such installers is
Windows, not much effort has been made to make unpackers portable to other
operating systems.

There are cases however, where there is a legitimate motivation to extract the
installable files on other platforms: One such example is the redistribution of
older software, for which alternative or ported versions exist. These normally
don't include required data files, as those are covered by a different
license than the ported software itself. See the links for (legal) distributors
of such software.

The data extraction routines are loosely based on the Inno Setup source code,
but entirely rewritten due to large differences in programming languages and
to improve portability. Some data structures may be reproduced in comments to
help with reimplementation. These will be removed when implementation and
testing is complete.
See http://www.jrsoftware.org/files/is/license.txt for the Inno Setup license.

Starting with commit 8ddd28f5b9e8ff68516065da0843459d44063739, new data
structure parsers are autogenerated by a script, which processes the InnoSetup
source. A second script to check out the InnoSetup git repository and attach
previous versions only available as zip archives is provided.


3. Usage

At its current stage, uninno is provided mainly as a library for dissecting
and analyzing Inno Setup installers. For quick-and-dirty extraction, run
the extract.pl tool on your installer:

$ ./extract.pl setup.exe

Output will be sent to /tmp/uninno.

To support various compression methods, the Perl modules from IO-Compress are
required, as well as the command line utility xz from xz-utils. IO-Compress
does not work with non-standard or raw LZMA1 streams, so we have to rely on
the external program for now.


4. Development

uninno consists of a bunch of Perl packages that handle different stages of the
analysis and extractiong process. Dissection of the installer executable is
provided by Win::Exe, which has some submodules for each of the PE's parts.
Setup::Inno provides a frontend for parsing the setup.0 (metadata) and setup.1
(compressed files) parts of the Inno Setup installer.

To improve code reuse and facilitate handling of all the installer versions,
all version-specific code is represented in a (linear) class hierarchy, spanning
from a base class with simple code stubs over the first open source Inno Setup
release (2.0.8) up to the most recent version. Each class in the hierarchy has
override points that implement data structures, decompression and custom
handling required for this version or its descendants.

Version numbers are coded in 4 digits: x.y.z -> xyzz. The last version part has
two digits and is zero padded. Example: 2.0.8 -> 2008

To find the override point of a method in the hierarchy, use the following code:
sub findovr {
	my ($method, $basever) = @_;
	require "Setup/Inno/Struct$basever.pm";
	my @classes = ("Setup::Inno::Struct$basever");
	while (@classes) {
		my $class = shift(@classes);
		no strict 'refs';
		unshift(@classes, @{$class . '::ISA'});
		my $fqn = $class . '::' . $method;
		if (defined(&{$fqn})) {
			return $class;
		}
	}
}
# Finds out which class overrides ParseOffsetTable, starting from Struct5200
print(findovr('ParseOffsetTable', '5200') . "\n");

InnoSetup has used many different compression algorithms in the course of its
history, with varying degrees of compatibility with standard software.
zlib, bzip2, LZMA and LZMA2 compression are supported by uninno, using
corresponding Perl modules. These are: IO::Uncompress::AnyInflate for zlib,
IO::Uncompress::Bunzip2 for bzip2 and Compress::Raw::Lzma for LZMA and LZMA2.
LZMA compression uses a lot of memory currently and performance is poor, as
the API of Compress::Raw::Lzma is very low-level and hard to use in a
straight-forward way.

Starting with support for InnoSetup 5.5.0, a new approach is used to create the
various structure parsers. Using a custom Delphi grammar based on an old edition
of the Delphi Language Guide, Projects/Struct.pas from the InnoSetup sourc code
is processed and dissected. Then, a Perl module is generated that can parse
binary data represented by the data structures in that file. The grammar can be
found in DelphiGrammar.pm, the code for the generator in ParserGenerator.pm.

To generate a new parser, you need to install Marpa::R2. You also need the
specific InnoSetup Struct.pas you'd like to implement support for.
The makeissrc.pl utility can clone out the official git repository for you and
optionally patch in older versions from their respective source files. It will
put the repository into ./innosetup by default.

The makestruct.pl tool can then be used to access this repository to generate
new parsers for a specific InnoSetup version.

Run:
makestruct.pl --src /path/to/innosetup --version 5.5.0u

specifying the source code path and the version number.
Versions with a u at the end are Unicode versions, which means that all strings
are interpreted as UTF-16. Non-Unicode installers have their strings stored
using Windows code page 1252. It is recommended to always create a Unicode and
a non-Unicode version when generating a parser for a new version.
Output will go to Struct5500u.pm in this case, which needs to be put into
Setup/Inno/ to make Inno.pm find it.
